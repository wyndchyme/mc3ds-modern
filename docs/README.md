# Overview
This is a modpack for Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition that aims to modernize the game. This pack adds new texture packs (including a 100% conversion of the post-1.14 textures), a new look for the game's user interface and icons, the original Minecraft font, the ability to swap between fonts at will in the Language menu, and more.

__This pack only officially supports English (US) and English (UK). Other languages can be used but will have lesser compatibility with Modernization MegaPack and the larger font.__

__This pack comes with a CTRPF plugin. Please ensure you read the [requirements.](#requirements)__

# Requirements
- A physical/digital copy of Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition
- Update 1.9.19 installed on your console
- The <b>LATEST</b> version of Luma
- Purchased DLC (for access to Classic texture pack)

_DLC for Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition is no longer avaliable for download as of 27 March 2023, apart from using third-party tools found on the internet to activate the full set of DLC released over the game's lifespan. The use of these tools can be considered piracy and is not endorsed by Modernization MegaPack._

<br>

# Installation
## Method 1
### Manual (Fastest) 
_Requires access to a microSD card reader_ **OR** _an FTP client._

1. Ensure that you have game patching enabled in your Luma settings by holding the Select button on startup. **If there is an '(x)' to the left of 'Enable game patching' in your Luma settings, then game patching is enabled.**
2. Download the latest release of Modernization MegaPack **for your region** from the [releases page](https://github.com/wyndchyme/mc3ds-modern/releases).
3. Extract the .ZIP file you downloaded and open the 'titles' directory. Look for the folder starting with **'0004'.** This is the folder you will move onto your console.
4. Open your console's microSD card using a microSD card reader or an FTP client.
5. On the root (highest level) of your microSD card, there should be a directory named 'luma'. Enter that directory and look for a directory named 'titles'. If the 'titles' directory is not present, create it.
6. Enter 'titles' and move the folder beginning with **'0004'** from step 3 into the 'titles' directory.
7. In the .ZIP folder you downloaded in step 2, enter the 'plugins' directory. Move the folder beginning with **'0004'** into the 'plugins' directory found within the 'luma' directory from step 5. If the 'plugins' directory is not present, create it.
8. Ensure you have the latest version of Luma3DS installed.
9. Enable the Plugin Loader and Input Redirection (in the miscellaneous section) of the Rosalina menu.
10. Launch Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition. If the game displays the new Mojang Studios logo (**not** the default black and red Mojang logo from the vanilla game) then the modpack has been applied successfully.

### MANUALLY UPDATING MODERNIZATION MEGAPACK

Delete the folders beginning with **'0004'** from the 'titles' and 'plugins' directories and repeat the process above using the latest release. 

<br>

## Method 2
### UniStore (Automatic)
_Requires internet access on your New Nintendo 3DS system and Universal-Updater. Installation may take a long time, please be patient._

1. Ensure that you have game patching enabled in your Luma settings by holding the Select button on startup. **If there is an '(x)' to the left of 'Enable game patching' in your Luma settings, then game patching is enabled.**
2. Ensure that you have **Universal-Updater** installed on your console. [Universal-Updater can be downloaded here.](https://universal-team.net/projects/universal-updater)
3. Open Universal-Updater and press the Settings icon in the bottom left corner of the touch screen. Press **'Select UniStore...'**
4. At the bottom of the 'Select a UniStore' screen, press the + button. Select **'Minecraft 3DS Community Unistore'** on the 'Recommended UniStores'.
5. Return to the 'Select a UniStore' screen and select minecraft-3ds-community.unistore.
6. Find or search for Modernization MegaPack. Press 'A' while you have it selected. Select the correct download for your region from the 'Avaliable Downloads' screen.
7. Press the 'Queue' button on the touch screen (directly above the search button) and press 'Action required!'
8. Press 'Accept' when prompted.
9. Wait for Modernization MegaPack installation to complete. This may take a long time.
10. Ensure you have the latest version of Luma3DS installed.
11. Enable the Plugin Loader and Input Redirection (in the miscellaneous section) of the Rosalina menu.
12. After installation is complete, quit Universal-Updater and launch Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition. If the game displays the new Mojang Studios logo (**not** the default black and red Mojang logo from the vanilla game) then the modpack has been applied successfully.

### UPDATING MODERNIZATION MEGAPACK WITH UNIVERSAL-UPDATER

In the Minecraft 3DS Community Unistore, navigate to 'Customization Removal' and remove all mods intalled. Reinstall Modernization MegaPack by repeating steps 5-12 above. Note that the UniStore may take some time to add the latest version of Modernization MegaPack.

<br>

## Method 3
### Source Files (Not Recommended)
_Prerelease builds may be unstable or contain unfinished features. Not recommended for general use, please refer to Method 1 or 2._

1. Ensure that you have game patching enabled in your Luma settings by holding the Select button on startup. **If there is an '(x)' to the left of 'Enable game patching' in your Luma settings, then game patching is enabled.**
2. Open [Modernization MegaPack's GitHub repository.](https://github.com/wyndchyme/mc3ds-modern)
3. Select 'Code' and 'Download ZIP'.
4. Extract the .ZIP file you downloaded.
5. Create a folder called 'romfs'. Move all folders that were in the ZIP you downloaded (excluding the 'megapackPlugin' and 'docs' directories) into this folder.
6. Create another folder with a name that corresponds to your region's Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition title ID, and move 'code.bps' into this folder. These title IDs are:
   - For USA:
   00040000001B8700
   - For EUR:
   000400000017CA00
   - For JPN:
   000400000017FD00
7. Move the 'romfs' folder you created earlier into the folder you created in step 6.
8. Open your console's microSD card using a microSD card reader or an FTP client.
9. On the root (highest level) of your microSD card, there should be a directory named 'luma'. Enter that directory and look for a directory named 'titles'. If the 'titles' directory is not present, create it.
10. Enter 'titles' and move the folder beginning with **'0004'** from step 6 into the 'titles' directory.
11. Return to the 'luma' directory and enter the 'plugins' directory. If the 'plugins' directory is not present, create it. Create another folder using the same title ID you used in step 6. Move the 'megapackPlugin.3gx' file into this directory.
12. Ensure you have the latest version of Luma installed.
13. Enable the Plugin Loader and Input Redirection (in the miscellaneous section) of the Rosalina menu.
14. Launch Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition. If the game displays the new Mojang Studios logo (**not** the default black and red Mojang logo from the vanilla game) then the modpack has been applied successfully.

### UPDATING MODERNIZATION MEGAPACK FROM SOURCE FILES
**NOT RECOMMENDED**

Delete the folders beginning with **'0004'** from the 'titles' and 'plugins directories and repeat the above process.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
 
<summary>Click to show/hide FAQs</summary>

<br>

<h2>Q: Moving the camera using the C-Stick doesn't seem to be working!</h2>
<p>A: Try pressing 'Start InputRedirection' in the Rosalina menu's miscellaneous section..</p>

<h2>Q: How large is Modernization MegaPack?</h2>
<p>A: As of version 2.2.0 "Byron" the extracted files amount to around 34.1 MB.</p>

<h2>Q: Does Modernization MegaPack affect world generation?</h2>
<p>A: No, world generation is not affected so the pack retains 100% compatibility with the vanilla game.</p>

<h2>Q: Can Modernization MegaPack cause my game to crash?</h2>
<p>A: Extremely unlikely – the way LayeredFS works and the current extent of Modernization MegaPack's changes mean that causing game crashes or performance issues is almost impossible. If you are having issues with the game repeatedly crashing on certain worlds, it is likely an issue with that world, your microSD card, or your console. If you are experiencing crashing issues traceable to Modernization MegaPack, a common troubledshooting method is deleting 'code.bps' from the title directory.</p>

<h2>Q: Why does installation on the UniStore take so long?</h2>
<p>A: The way the UniStore works is that it downloads the Modernization MegaPack archive file and extracts each directory into its correct spot. The 3DS takes a long time to extract archived files, so this obviously takes longer than just moving the already extracted files onto your microSD card.</p>

<h2>Q: On the UniStore, downloading Modernization MegaPack causes the download to fail, or the changes aren't showing even though I have game patching enabled!</h2>
<p>A: Ensure that your internet connection is working correctly. If it is, then this is likely an issue on the UniStore's end. File an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/Minecraft-3ds-unistore/issues">UniStore's GitHub repository</a>. In the meantime, please refer to Method 1.</p>

<h2>Q: I have a contribution for Modernization MegaPack! Where can I put it?</h2>
<p>A: Contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, make your changes, and then file a pull request.</p>

<h2>Q: I have a suggestion for Modernization MegaPack! Where can I put it?</h2>
<p>A: Please file an issue <a href="https://github.com/wyndchyme/mc3ds-modern/issues">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Q: Is there documentation available for Modernization MegaPack?</h2>
<p>A: Documentation can be found <a href="https://wyndchyme.github.io/consoles/3ds/docs/mc3ds-modern/">here</a>.</p>
